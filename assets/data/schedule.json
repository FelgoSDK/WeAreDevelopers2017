Colin McFarland, Head of Experimentation at Skyscanner, developed the global travel search business from being a small-scale experimentation to a state where the practice is ingrained, with hundreds of experiments undertaken each month. This talk will provide practical insights on how to augment experimentation within a business, expanding on the case for causality, common pitfalls to avoid, and how tooling and education can drive the data-focussed culture that is so essential in delivering a competitive edge.",

Reliable and flexible access control mechanisms are a prerequisite for such organizations to use data effectively and responsibly. Gatekeeper is Palantir’s central authorization system for services and data assets. It allows services to specify access controls on their endpoints and data assets via a graph of abstract resources and their policies. The graph encodes both the hierarchical (e.g., folders and files) and the logical (e.g., produced-by, depends-on) structure of its resources. The Gatekeeper service encapsulates the policy inference logic on the graph and thus allows its users to ask simple “has-access?” questions on single resources even when the structure of the effective resource policy is complex. This talk first reviews the requirements and lessons learned that led the design of Gatekeeper’s policy language and then details its implementation as a highly-availably service.",

Voice is the future of interfaces.\n\nIn this talk, Preethi will start by walking through the evolution of computer input interfaces, starting with punchcards all the way to conversational interfaces via voice. The challenge with conversational interfaces, however, is that we need to figure out how to get computers to process or “understand” natural language. Humans (we) learn through experience — so how can we help machines learn through experience? This challenge is the heart of some of world’s leading AI research.\n\nPreethi will explain the current approaches to understanding natural language which use NLP and Deep Learning. She’ll show how a computer can now begin to reason like a human being with remarkable accuracy — and perform other useful tasks like question answering, translation, and sentiment analysis. Lastly, she’ll talk through the many unsolved challenges in understanding human language — and her predictions for the future.",

In this talk, we’ll be looking at the challenges of working with machine data alongside the tooling and best practices to help you tackle the whole life cycle of working with machine data. We’ll look at machine data generation, transfer, storage, analysis, and how to cope with large-scale data that never dies. This talk will include a live demo showing MQTT transfer of machine data, ingestion, storage in the CrateDB-distributed database, the application of visualization tools, and machine learning to add extra value to the data.",

Yes, it is interesting, but investing time and effort on our own planet has its advantages as well. We still don’t know much about some parts of our own home and satellites provide us with an excellent opportunity to extract information about the weather, climate, other atmospheric and surface parameters - and the best part: they don’t require countless individuals to do the measuring. Win-Win? Obviously yes, but where are the problems?\nData. Data. Data. And some more data. There are scientists all over the world doing their part in understanding how different parameters influence each other and lead to new insights and applications. But someone has to implement/realize this on all available data. So what exactly are the difficulties we’re facing and how can they be solved? Let me introduce you to high performance computing and all the challenges that come with it!",

It will be a time lapse version of a voyage I undertook myself at my previous employer, a Vienna-based company that develops business applications for data management for the financial services industry. As part of a team that worked on a product for managing corporate actions data, I spearheaded the introduction of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). Using BDD, we were able to address weaknesses in the way that requirements were analysed, communicated and verified.\n\nYour voyage with me will take us back to the first steps my team and I took with BDD. Together, we will re-trace the course towards the first specification using examples, and on to the first automated verification of a feature. We will see how the BDD effort achieved critical momentum and started snowballing. We will also analyse several roadblocks that put a ceiling on the effectiveness of BDD, and come up with ways to improve on such situations.\n\nWhen you attend this session, you will learn how we approached BDD and made it work for us. You will also learn about the problems we had with BDD. The knowledge of both of these topics will give you guidance on how to apply BDD more effectively in your own projects, and on how to avoid some pitfalls.",

In contrast, I find programs with minimal abstractions and lots of conditional logic hard to understand because there is little or no theory to be inferred.  \n\nFor several years I’ve been trying to relate the many models that I build on software projects and I believe it’s a combination of models of the domain, the solution, and mathematical logic. So, what value does a team provide? Is it just the code? I argue that:\n\n(1) programs that embody the theories of their developers are more valuable.\n(2) how well developers can evolve a program is related to their ability to build and evolve theories, and\n(3) a key distinguishing characteristic of a company’s most senior developers are their theory-building traits.",

Next to establishing a pattern library and thereby introducing a Design System we started to rethink the way we build our user interfaces in code and design. We adapted several methodologies like Atomic Design, changed our design development workflows, did a CSS refactoring – called Project Ironman – , improved our front-end stack and changed the way we build our assets and started to rebuild the core UI components of our main product in 2016.\nThe talk will provide insights in our journey with rebuilding our UI at large scale in an iterative way. It will present the challenges we encountered in code, design and our processes and how we solved them. The outcome will be highlighted with real data and some of our business metrics. However it will also show some of our mistakes we did while integrating the Design System and will present the lessons we have learned out of that.",

Ten years later, Google introduced Dataflow - a new paradigm, integrating batch and stream processing in one common abstraction. This time the offer was more than a paper, but also an open source Java SDK and a cloud managed service to run it. In 2016 big data players like Cask, Cloudera, Data Artisans, PayPal, Slack, Talend joined Google to propose Dataflow for incubation at the Apache Software Foundation - Dataflow is here, not only unifying batch and streaming, but also the big data world.",

Learn why that statement is so wrong and how to make tests a ‘must have’ in your workflow. It’s a common mistake that tests take lots of time, while actually the truth is that initial manual testing is the overhead. The presentation will be focused on how to incorporate tests into your regular workflow, and why you shouldn’t write tests after your application code. The presentation will be also filled with personal experiences and excuses I’ve heard over the years for not writing tests.",

In this session we look into integrating robots into software-controlled business processes. Using the example of Anki Cozmo and SAP Cloud Platform we show how to connect robots to the cloud. We demonstrate how to collect sensor readings from robots in a central database. Once in the cloud the data can be made accessible for visualization, analytics, machine learning and other data science techniques. We also show how decisions made based on the collected data can be used for remote controlling the robot. In this session expect to see some Cozmo SDK, Python and the SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Things Service in action.",
